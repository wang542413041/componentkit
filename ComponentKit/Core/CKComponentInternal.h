/**
 Mounts the component in the given context:
 - Stores references to the supercomponent and superview for -nextResponder and -viewConfiguration.
 - Creates or updates a controller for this component, if one should exist.
 - If this component has a view, creates or recycles a view by fetching one from the given MountContext, and:
   - Unmounts the view's previous component (if any).
   - Applies attributes to the view.
   - Stores a reference to the view in _mountedView (for -viewContext, transient view state, and -unmount).
   - Stores a reference back to this component using CKSetMountedComponentForView. (This sets up a
     retain cycle which must be torn down in -unmount.)

 Override this if your component wants to perform a custom mounting action, but this should be very rare!

 @param context The component's content should be positioned within the given view at the given position.
 @param layout The layout that is being mounted
 @param supercomponent This component's parent component
 @return An updated mount context. In most cases, this is just be the passed-in context. If a view was created, this is
 used to specify that subcomponents should be mounted inside the view.
