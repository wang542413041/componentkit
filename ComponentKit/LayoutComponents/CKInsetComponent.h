/**
 @uidocs https://fburl.com/CKInsetComponent:ac83

 A component that wraps another component, applying insets around it.

 If the child component has a size specified as a percentage, the percentage is resolved against this component's parent
 size **after** applying insets.

 @note
 CKOuterComponent contains an CKInsetComponent with an CKInnerComponent. Suppose that:
 - CKOuterComponent is 200pt wide.
 - CKInnerComponent specifies its width as 100%.
 - The CKInsetComponent has insets of 10pt on every side.
 CKInnerComponent will have size 180pt, not 200pt, because it receives a parent size that has been adjusted for insets.

 If you're familiar with CSS: CKInsetComponent's child behaves similarly to "box-sizing: border-box".

 An infinite inset is resolved as an inset equal to all remaining space after applying the other insets and child size.
 @note
 An CKInsetComponent with an infinite left inset and 10px for all other edges will position it's child 10px from the right edge.
